          Hi, my name is Deann and I am a web developer with USA and EU
          citizenship currently based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
          <br />
          <br />I am thrilled to have just completed an intensive Fullstack
          JavaScript bootcamp, and am now eager to start my career in software
          development. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end
          development, I am confident in my ability to build dynamic and
          responsive web applications using popular frameworks like React, as
          well as Node.js and other back-end technologies.
          <br />
          <br /> I am passionate about software development and find myself
          constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
          I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with teams to develop
          cutting-edge solutions to real-world problems, and contributing to the
          success of organisations through my technical expertise and innovative
          ideas. <br />
          <br />
          Overall, I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual with a
          strong work ethic, and I am committed to continuously improving my
          skills and knowledge as a software developer. I am excited about what
          the future holds and am ready to take on new challenges in the field
          of software development. <br />
          <br />I have hands-on experience with a variety of technologies,
          including: HTML5, CSS3, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, UX/UI design, Git, REST
          APIs, CI/CD, test-driven development, JavaScript, TypeScrip, Node.js,
          React.js, and Express.js.
