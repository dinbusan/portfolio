          Hi, my name is Deann and I am a web developer with USA and EU
          citizenship currently based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
          <br />
          <br />
          After teaching in the USA and South Korea for the past 8, I took the initiative to
          self-study and learn the basics of programming. However, I soon
          realized that I needed more structured training to further develop my
          skills. Determined to pursue a career in software engineering, I made
          the difficult decision to end my education career and move to the
          Netherlands to join an intensive full-stack JavaScript bootcamp. This
          decision has proven to be one of the best I have made, as it allowed
          me to gain hands-on experience in developing complex web applications
          using modern technologies and best practices.
          <br />
          <br /> I am passionate about software development and find myself
          constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
          I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with teams to develop
          cutting-edge solutions to real-world problems, and contributing to the
          success of organisations through my technical expertise and innovative
          ideas. <br />
          <br />
          Overall, I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual with a
          strong work ethic, and I am committed to continuously improving my
          skills and knowledge as a software developer. I am excited about what
          the future holds and am ready to take on new challenges in the field
          of software development. <br />
          <br />I have hands-on experience with a variety of technologies,
          including: HTML5, CSS3, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, UX/UI design, Git, REST
          APIs, CI/CD, test-driven development, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js,
          React.js, and Express.js.
